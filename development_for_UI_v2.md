For an enterprise-grade HPC management platform built around your backend architecture:

* `cockpit-slurm-bridge` (persistent backend service)
* `cockpit-slurm-channel` (lightweight per-session channel process)
* `cockpit.channel()` streaming API
* frontend built with Cockpit and PatternFly
* backend integration with Slurm

I would design the UI more like an enterprise cloud console rather than a traditional HPC dashboard.

# 1. Multi-level Navigation Structure

A production HPC environment usually contains hundreds of nodes, thousands of jobs, multiple partitions, accounts and QoS policies.

A left navigation tree scales better than dashboard cards alone.

Example:

```text
Dashboard
│
├── Overview
│
├── Compute
│   ├── Partitions
│   ├── Nodes
│   ├── Topology
│   └── Reservations
│
├── Workloads
│   ├── Running Jobs
│   ├── Pending Jobs
│   ├── Completed Jobs
│   └── Job Templates
│
├── Users & Accounts
│   ├── Users
│   ├── Accounts
│   ├── Associations
│   └── Limits
│
├── Storage
│   ├── Filesystems
│   ├── Quotas
│   └── Scratch Usage
│
├── Monitoring
│   ├── Cluster Metrics
│   ├── GPU Metrics
│   ├── Energy Usage
│   └── Alerts
│
├── Administration
│   ├── Cluster Config
│   ├── Daemons
│   ├── Audit Logs
│   └── Permissions
│
└── Settings
```

This is similar to cloud control panels and scales well beyond a single cluster.

---

# 2. Dashboard Should Focus On Operational State

Many HPC dashboards become unusable because they show every metric.

An operations dashboard should answer only:

* Is the cluster healthy?
* Are users blocked?
* Is capacity exhausted?
* Are nodes failing?

Suggested top row:

| Metric          | Example                      |
| --------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Cluster State   | Healthy / Warning / Critical |
| Running Jobs    | 248                          |
| Pending Jobs    | 37                           |
| Idle Nodes      | 12                           |
| Drained Nodes   | 4                            |
| GPU Utilization | 78%                          |
| Storage Usage   | 62%                          |

Second row:

* partition utilization heatmap
* node state distribution
* job state distribution
* scheduler efficiency trend

Third row:

* alerts
* recent failures
* maintenance events

---

# 3. Real-time Event Driven UI

Since you already have `cockpit.channel()` and a persistent cache layer, avoid polling from React components.

Instead:

```text
React Component
      ↓
Channel Subscription
      ↓
cockpit-slurm-channel
      ↓
cockpit-slurm-bridge cache
      ↓
generation update event
```

Example events:

```json
{
  "entity": "nodes",
  "generation": 134,
  "updated": 3,
  "removed": 1
}
```

Frontend updates only affected rows.

This architecture scales much better than:

```text
refresh table every 5 seconds
```

For large clusters this difference becomes enormous.

---

# 4. Entity Pages Rather Than Tables

Instead of:

```text
Nodes Table
```

Think:

```text
Node Detail Page
```

Example node page:

```text
Node: gpu001
────────────────────

State: Allocated
Partition: gpu
CPU Usage: 88%
Memory Usage: 71%
GPU Usage: 93%

Running Jobs
Users
GRES Allocation
Recent Events
System Journal
```

Similarly:

* User page
* Account page
* Partition page
* Job page

This matches how enterprise products present information.

---

# 5. Progressive Disclosure

Default tables should show only the important columns.

Example node table:

| Node | State | CPUs | Memory | GPUs | Jobs |
| ---- | ----- | ---- | ------ | ---- | ---- |

Expandable row:

```text
Sockets
Threads
GRES
Features
Weight
Reason
Boot Time
Power State
Version
```

You already use PatternFly expandable tables, which fit this model very well.

---

# 6. Role-Based Home Pages

You already have Admin/Operator/User roles.

Different roles should see different landing pages.

## Admin

* cluster health
* failed nodes
* daemon state
* scheduler performance

## Operator

* running jobs
* reservations
* maintenance tasks
* draining nodes

## User

* my jobs
* quota usage
* project usage
* favorite job templates

This reduces cognitive load dramatically.

---

# 7. Global Search

Large clusters require search everywhere.

Top navigation search box:

```text
Search:

gpu014
job 421341
user alice
account chemistry
partition gpu
```

Results open directly to detail pages.

This becomes one of the most-used features in production.

---

# 8. Job Submission Wizard

Many users struggle with batch scripts.

Provide a wizard:

```text
Application
    ↓
Resources
    ↓
Modules
    ↓
Runtime
    ↓
Review
    ↓
Submit
```

Generated output:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
#SBATCH ...
module load ...
srun ...
```

Advanced users can switch to raw script mode.

---

# 9. Notification Center

Enterprise operators need visibility.

Examples:

```text
Node gpu005 drained
Filesystem nearly full
Scheduler backlog exceeded threshold
slurmctld restarted
License server unavailable
```

A notification center is often more useful than another chart.

---

# 10. Cluster Topology View

For HPC environments this becomes very valuable.

Example:

```text
Rack01
 ├── compute001
 ├── compute002
 └── compute003

Rack02
 ├── gpu001
 ├── gpu002
 └── gpu003
```

Node colors:

* green → idle
* blue → allocated
* yellow → mixed
* red → down
* gray → drained

Operators love this view during incidents.

---

# 11. Recommended Frontend Architecture

```text
src/
├── app/
├── pages/
├── features/
│   ├── nodes/
│   ├── jobs/
│   ├── users/
│   ├── accounts/
│   ├── partitions/
│   └── reservations/
│
├── channels/
│   ├── subscriptions/
│   ├── cache/
│   └── events/
│
├── contexts/
├── hooks/
├── services/
├── models/
└── shared/
```

Avoid placing API logic directly inside components.

Components should mostly consume hooks:

```typescript
const { data, loading } = useNodes();
const { submitJob } = useJobs();
const { refresh } = usePartitions();
```

---

# 12. The Feature That Usually Differentiates Commercial Products

If I had to pick one feature that separates a hobby project from an enterprise product, it would be:

```text
Real-time event driven updates
+
Global search
+
Entity detail pages
+
Role specific dashboards
```

Those four capabilities make the system feel comparable to modern cloud management platforms rather than a collection of tables over `scontrol` output.

Given your existing `bridge + channel + cache + generation ID` architecture, you are already moving toward a design very similar to:

* cluster state stores used by modern container platforms,
* subscription-based UIs,
* event-driven cloud control planes.

That architecture is considerably more scalable than having every React component execute `cockpit.spawn()` independently.

---

# 13. Recommended Execution Order

The document is strongest when it is used as a delivery sequence rather than a
wish list. I would implement it in this order:

1. Canonical data contracts for nodes, jobs, partitions, users, and accounts.
2. Bridge and channel snapshot/update flow with generation tracking.
3. Core navigation shell and role-based landing pages.
4. Entity list pages with detail pages for nodes and jobs first.
5. Global search and notifications.
6. Job submission wizard and topology view.

Suggested MVP scope:

* Overview dashboard
* Node list and node detail page
* Job list and job detail page
* Partition list
* Real-time cache updates

This gives you a usable operator product before adding the broader enterprise
features.

---

# 14. Data Model Contract

Yes, the data model can be the shared template for both backend and frontend,
but only if it is treated as the canonical contract layer.

Recommended rule:

* Slurm sources define semantics.
* Canonical JSON schemas define the contract.
* Go structs implement the backend side of that contract.
* TypeScript interfaces mirror the same contract for the UI.

Do not use the database schema as the UI contract.
Do not let the React app parse raw Slurm text.

The practical shape should be:

```text
Slurm manuals / JSON output
    ↓
Canonical JSON model
    ↓
Go backend cache + events
    ↓
TypeScript frontend types
```

That approach keeps backend and frontend aligned while still allowing each
layer to evolve internally.

## 14.1 Concrete OpenAPI Workflow

Use the Slurm OpenAPI file at
`cmd/internal/models/slurm-25.05.7-openapi-v0.0.43.json` as the source input
for model generation.

Note: the Go generation part is already implemented in
`cmd/internal/models/openapi_generate.go`.

Current Go commands in that file:

```text
go generate ./internal/models
```

which runs:

```text
slurmrestd -d v0.0.43 --generate-openapi-spec > slurm-25.05.7-openapi-v0.0.43.json
oapi-codegen --generate types --package models -o slurm_openapi.gen.go slurm-25.05.7-openapi-v0.0.43.json
gofmt -w slurm_openapi.gen.go
```

Recommended workflow:

1. Keep Go generation owned by `openapi_generate.go`.
2. Keep the generated Go file (`slurm_openapi.gen.go`) isolated from
    handwritten adapter code.
3. Map generated Go types into backend domain models only where naming or shape
    needs to be normalized.
4. Add frontend generation from the same OpenAPI spec to produce TypeScript API
    types.
5. Build smaller PatternFly view models on top of those API types for tables,
    detail pages, forms, and filters.
6. Re-run generation whenever the Slurm version or schema changes, then compile
    both backend and frontend to catch drift early.

Practical split:

* Generated API types: source of truth for wire formats.
* Go domain models: backend cache, diffing, and event logic.
* TypeScript API types: frontend data access layer.
* PatternFly view models: UI-specific presentation state.

This is the safest way to reuse the OpenAPI file without tying the React UI to
raw generated schema names everywhere.

# Questions 

These are exactly the kinds of questions that appear when moving from a technical prototype to an enterprise product design.

## 1. How does Multi-level Navigation map to Role-based Home Pages?

The key idea is:

> Navigation tree defines **what the platform supports**.
>
> Home page defines **what this role needs first**.

The navigation structure can remain largely identical across roles, while visibility and default landing pages differ.

For example:

### Visitor (`Not Set`)

```text
Home
├── Dashboard
├── Documentation
├── Cluster Status
├── Available Resources
└── Request Access
```

Landing page:

```text
Welcome to HPC Portal

Cluster Status:
- 384 CPU nodes
- 32 GPU nodes
- 97% uptime

Available partitions:
- cpu
- gpu
- large-memory

[Request Account]
[Browse Documentation]
[Login]
```

This role behaves similarly to a cloud provider's public landing page.

---

### User

```text
Dashboard
├── Overview
├── My Jobs
├── Job Submission
├── My Projects
├── Storage
└── Documentation
```

Hidden:

```text
Administration
Accounts
Users
Reservations
```

Landing page:

```text
My Running Jobs
My Pending Jobs
Quota Usage
Recent Notifications
Favorite Job Templates
```

---

### Operator

```text
Dashboard
├── Overview
├── Compute
├── Workloads
├── Reservations
├── Monitoring
└── Documentation
```

Hidden:

```text
Accounts
Users
Cluster Configuration
```

Landing page:

```text
Drained Nodes
Pending Jobs
Partition Utilization
Cluster Alerts
```

---

### Admin

Full navigation:

```text
Dashboard
Compute
Workloads
Users & Accounts
Storage
Monitoring
Administration
Settings
```

Landing page:

```text
Cluster Health
Daemon Status
Scheduler Metrics
Security Events
Audit Logs
```

---

A useful implementation model is:

```typescript
type NavigationItem = {
    id: string;
    title: string;
    path: string;
    allowedRoles: Role[];
};
```

Example:

```typescript
{
    id: "users",
    title: "Users",
    path: "/users",
    allowedRoles: ["admin"]
}
```

while:

```typescript
{
    id: "jobs",
    title: "Jobs",
    path: "/jobs",
    allowedRoles: ["admin", "operator", "user"]
}
```

---

## 2. Cockpit already provides a left sidebar. How should cockpit-slurm organize navigation?

How to map your structure to this pattern:

### Sidebar
    Sidebar (manifest.json): Dashboard, Compute, Workloads, Users, Storage, Monitoring, Admin, Settings.

### Horizontal Tabs
    Horizontal Tabs (PatternFly <Tabs>): * When the user clicks "Compute", the main page loads with horizontal tabs at the top for: Partitions | Nodes | Topology | Reservations.

    When the user clicks "Workloads", the tabs are: Running | Pending | Completed | Templates.

This keeps the main navigation clean while providing immediate, logical access to sub-features.

## 3. Is it a good idea to add a `Not Set` role for visitors?

Yes, I think this is a very good idea.

In fact, I would rename it slightly:

```text
Guest
```

or

```text
Visitor
```

instead of:

```text
Not Set
```

because:

* `Not Set` sounds like a configuration error.
* `Guest` sounds intentional.
* `Visitor` sounds intentional.

However, if `Not Set` already exists in your OpenAPI schema as the internal enum value, you can still display:

```text
Internal value: Not Set
Displayed label: Guest
```

Example:

```go
type UserRole string

const (
    RoleGuest    UserRole = "Not Set"
    RoleUser     UserRole = "User"
    RoleOperator UserRole = "Operator"
    RoleAdmin    UserRole = "Admin"
)
```

UI mapping:

| Backend Value | UI Label      |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Not Set       | Guest         |
| User          | User          |
| Operator      | Operator      |
| Admin         | Administrator |

---

A guest role enables several enterprise features:

* self-registration
* account request workflow
* documentation access
* cluster status page
* maintenance announcements
* onboarding tutorials

This is particularly useful for:

* universities
* research institutes
* national supercomputing centers
* internal enterprise AI clusters

Many users spend time as guests before becoming actual users.

---

My suggested hierarchy would therefore become:

```text
Guest
   ↓
User
   ↓
Operator
   ↓
Administrator
```

This resembles how many enterprise infrastructure systems structure access levels and fits naturally with the onboarding process of HPC environments.

# Additional question
Can Data models for backend and front end. 

Can I use the slurmrestd openAPI output JSON file to declare (or alias ) types for front-end in PatternFly React ? 

The data models file is at /home/dev/cockpit-slurm/cmd/internal/models/slurm-25.05.7-openapi-v0.0.43.json.
